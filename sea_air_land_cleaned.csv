A fusion of bold design and an unwavering passion to create the world’s greatest tool watches. Inspired by the spirit of discovery and adventure presented in chasing the Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights, Bremont and Bamford Watch Dept. introduce a luminescent limited edition Supermarine GMT, imbued with each brand’s distinct DNA.
The Bremont Bamford Aurora is a limited edition of 500 pieces and presents a mission-ready and highly tactical design from the Supermarine collection, with GMT functionality and anti-shock protection. The design is defined by the striking all-black finish with a bold application of entrancing green emission Super-LumiNova®, reminiscent of the Aurora Borealis’ dancing ribbons of light, which captivate and inspire.
The 43mm Stainless Steel DLC-coated Trip-Tick case is complimented by a bi-coloured polished Sapphire 24-hour bezel for day and night indication, and a luminous California sandwich dial design. Vibrant green Super-LumiNova® permeates the design from the bezel to the cut-out numerals creating a highly legible dial with increased luminosity because of its ‘layered’ dial construction.
Turning the watch over reveals a DLC-coated decorated case-back and the strap is finished in black nubuck leather with green stitching and DLC-coated pin buckle to match.","Introducing the Bremont Bamford Aurora: a limited edition Supermarine GMT watch of 500 pieces, combining tactical prowess with striking design.

Based on the Big Island, Kaimu is a very young black sand beach with a rich history as it was devastated by an eruption from the nearby Kilauea volcano in 1990. Kaimu is an incredible example of endurance as the beach and local habitat have replenished, supported by locals and visitors planting sprouted coconuts in order to revitalise the local habitat and replaced the lost vegetation, restoring the area to its former beauty.",The 40mm mechanical steel and ceramic timepiece presents a new aesthetic within the already iconic Supermarine collection fusing elegance and technical excellence to create this stylish addition.,, , , , , , ,

The Vigo is inspired by its namesake Spanish coastline in north-western Spain where the fine white sands and clear waters create an idyllic set of beaches, wild coves, and estuaries. This particular spot captured the imagination of Bremont Co-Founders Nick and Giles English when they sailed there as children, aboard the Lady K which had been built by their father as a gift to their mother.

Martin-Baker is the British aviation company responsible for supplying 70% of the world’s air-forces with fighter ejection seat technology. To date, the firm has saved over 7,600 lives.
Martin-Baker first approached Bremont to create the definitive aviation watch back in 2007. More than simply putting a logo on an existing model, the watch had to withstand the same rigorous testing programme as the ejection seats themselves including Live Ejection Testing, MFOS Crashworthy Testing, Extreme Temperature Endurance, Vibration Testing, Altitude Testing and Aircraft Carrier Deck Testing. Two years later, the Bremont MBI was born. The limited edition MBI remains solely for pilots who have ejected from an aircraft using a Martin-Baker seat whereas the MBII and MBIII are available to all.
The updated MBII design boasts a more contemporary styling of the numerals for a clean look. Its refreshed case back design is inset with a bronze coloured ‘military challenge coin’, historically used to represent membership of a group of people or service on a specific tour of duty.
The Bremont MB has become something of an icon in the worlds of civilian and military aviation, it quite literally redefined the aviation watch space.",Designed to withstand the same rigorous testing programme that the Martin-Baker ejection seats go through including live ejection testing.,Sapphire Crystal, , , , , , ,
